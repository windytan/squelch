squelch
=======

squelch zeroes an incoming PCM signal to digital silence when sufficiently quiet
for a sufficient time. This can be helpful when compressing a recorded signal
using RLE, for example.

Signal comes in through stdin and the squelched signal is written to stdout.

Stream format is assumed to be raw signed-integer PCM.
