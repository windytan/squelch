squelch
=======

squelch zeroes an incoming PCM signal to digital silence when sufficiently quiet
for a sufficient time. This can be helpful when compressing a recorded signal
using RLE, for example.

Signal comes in through stdin and the squelched signal is written to stdout.

Stream format is assumed to be raw 16-bit signed-integer PCM.


Compiling
---------

make


Usage
-----

some_program --producing --samples | squelch [OPTION]... | ...


Command line options
--------------------

  -u SAMPLES
      output buffer length, samples; defaults to 2048

  -l LEVEL
      silence threshold, in absolute amplitude; defaults to 1024 (-30 dB)

  -L LEVEL
      silence threshold, in dB; internally sets absolute amplitude; (e.g. `-L -30`)

  -d SAMPLES
      duration of silence to trigger squelch, in samples; defaults to 4096

  -t SAMPLES
      transition time, in samples; defaults to 512

If both level options are set, the latter wins.
